# Green Leaf Library

Description: 

This project allows people to search the library's online catalog by key word, title or author to find the books
they are interested in. Each found result links to a dialog box that displays all information of the book, including 
its cover image, the current status (in library or lent out) and the ratings. Registered users can view their lending 
records and rate the books they borrowed. Administrator is responsible for managing (e.g. adding/updating/deleting) 
all information of users, books and the lending records.
